     Corrections Table

Optionally, you can load image processing corrections from
a template DAI file (like the "Get" button on the Image
Processing window).

Template: Select an image DAI file containing image processing
steps that you'd like to apply to all images generated by 
this Wizard.

This table will also allow Display ranges to be modified.

     Table Controls

Edit Corrections

You can add a new image correction by selecting the element in
the first droplist, the operation in the second and hit "Add".

You can "Delete" entries in the table or "Clear" it entirely.

Edit Display

Enter the display range desired into "Bottom" and "Top"
fields, which function like the Bottom and Top sliders under 
the images in the main Image window. 

Optionally also set the "Log" function, which accepts the
values 0 (Linear), 1 (Log) and 2 (SQRT).

Then select a row in the table by clicking in a cell, and
hit "Apply" to apply these settings to all rows for that
element.
