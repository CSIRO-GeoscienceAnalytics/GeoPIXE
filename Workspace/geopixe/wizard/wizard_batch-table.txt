     Work and Results Table

Table is populated using metadata where available. Missing
entries will need to be added. Click in a cell to edit it, 
or use "Fill" to duplicate it down the selected column.

The processing will image each standard, extract a region
over the central 95% of the area, and calculate the "conv"
factor based on the concentration estimated from the
region compared to the "standards.csv" config file. 

This analysis will ignore pixels with no data. Technically,
it only includes pixels within 0.8 and 1.2 times the 'mode',
or most common pixel value.

See the results in the "conv" column of the table and on 
the "Statistics" and "Plots" tabs.

     Controls

Enable: Toggle the enable state of selected rows.

Fill: Duplicate down selected columns. 

Delete: Delete selected row(s).

Clear: Clears entire table.

Process: Start the processing.

     Selection of cells

Click in a cell to select it. Click and drag to select
multiple rows and/or columns. Selecting the "pileup" and
"throttle" cells will bring up the file requester. All
other cells using the same file-name will be updated too.

     Results File

The results and statistics are exported to a file
called "wizard-standards-results.csv" in the designated
output directory, in comma-separated format.
