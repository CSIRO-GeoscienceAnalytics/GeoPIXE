     RGB Exports table

Here you can specify a list of RGB element combinations for
RGB Image exports.

You can also set zoom parameters, which allow export at 
full resolution (zoom=0), zoomed in to a smaller image 
(zoom<0) or expanded (zoom>0). The Zoom parameters are
effectively powers of 2 in image scaling and mimic the "+"
and "-" buttons under the image windows.

RGB Export: Select a rgb.csv file to load the RGB combinations 
from. This file may have been setup using the "Learn" menu on
the RGB Images window or previously in the Batch Wizard.

     Table Controls

and hit "Delete". 

Clear: Clear the table using "Clear".

Save: Write the RGB combinations into a new rgb.csv file to
use here, or with the "Learn" menu in the RGB Image window.
