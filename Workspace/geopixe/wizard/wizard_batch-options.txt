     Processing, Save & Export Options

Select file creation, image correction and export options.

File Options

Here you can select to Skip the sort if an image DAI file
already exists, indicating that the processing has been done.

Use the Overwrite option to force overwriting the sorted DAI
filename, rather than the default behaviour to append a 
"-m.dai" or "-x.dai" to create a "modified" image file. This
saves disk space. But it may be better to keep the original
images.

Processing and Corrections Options

The first option "Apply corrections to image" will be
enabled if corrections have been defined on tab 2.

Export and Save Options

After the Images are sorted, corrected and saved, select 
various output and export options here.

If RGB Export options have been defined on tab 3, these
will be enabled here.
