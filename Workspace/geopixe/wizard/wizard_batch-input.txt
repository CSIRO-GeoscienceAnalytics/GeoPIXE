     Batch Wizard

The Wizard is used to process a series of raw data files
into output image DAI files. The setup is organized on 4
tabs. Click "Next >>" to move to each new tab.

Tab 1. User Input

First set the Device type for the raw data. This is essential
to find the correct raw data files.

Raw dir: Path where our raw data resides.

Output path: The "analysis" directory where output images 
are written.

Energy Cal: Select an energy cal SPEC file, which will be used
to enable detector channels and set the energy cals for all 
detectors.

Template: Select an image DAI file to supply default settings
and the important DA matrix from processing. These settings 
will be sent to the Sort EVT where you may modify them.
Set "Cluster" mode there too.

Tab 2. Corrections Table

Optionally, you can load image processing corrections from
a template DAI file (like the "Get" button on the Image
Processing window).

This table will also allow Display ranges to be modified.

Tab 3. RGB Exports

Here you can specify a list of RGB element combinations for
RGB Image exports. You can also load these from a rgb.csv
file, as setup using the "Learn" menu on the RGB Images
window.

Tab 4. Options

Select the file, processing and save/export options here.

Tab 5. Processing Table

Here you scan the raw data dir for data files, which fills
in a table of key parameters, and "Start Processing".


Advance to the next tab using "Next >>" or use "<< Back"
to return the previous tab. You can also select tabs directory.
Hit "Figure" to reopen any diagram for a tab (if available).
