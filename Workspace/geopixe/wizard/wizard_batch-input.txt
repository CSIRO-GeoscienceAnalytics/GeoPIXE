     Standards Analysis Wizard

The Wizard will search for all "standards" foil image scan
data-sets in the selected 'blog' directory. Standards will
be indentified by 'sample_type' metadata as "standard".

Each will be imaged using pre-calculated DA matrix files.
These files are stored in the GeoPIXE Resource area, which
can be selected here (defaults to the value of the "path
config" in your "~/.geopixe/geopixe.conf" file).

"Resources" is used to set the path to the top level of 
the <config> directory.

e.g.  at XFM =  Resources: \XFM\config\geopixe_config\

The <config> data is assumed to be stored in a tree divided
by detector ID and energy:
     <config>/<detector>/standards/<energy>/

DA matrix files assumed to be named similarly:
     e.g. path in config: 384C14/standards/18500eV/
            file: Pt_MM15931_384C14_18500eV.damx

Each standard will be imaged using the appropriate DA 
matrix and a large region selected to determine average 
conc. This will be compared to the certified value to 
determine the conversion factor 'conv'.

Results are stored in the Table on tab two. Image 
statistics are shown on tab three and "conv" values
are plotted on tab four.

The certified values for standards come from the file:
     <config>/standards/standards.csv

Scan Blog Dir: Scan blog dir for data files and populate
     table based on metadata.
