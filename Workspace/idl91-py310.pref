# This file is used to retain preference values that differ
# from IDL's built in default values. IDL reads it every
# time it starts, so changes made here persist between IDL
# sessions.
#
# You can edit this file using any standard text editor.
# The preferences and their allowed values are described
# in the IDL documentation which is included with IDL.
# Please note that IDL has a user level API for managing
# user preferences (HELP,/PREFERENCES, PREF_SET, PREF_GET).
# Although you are allowed to edit the file directly, it is
# not necessary that you do so.
#
# Before editing this file, you must first ensure that
# there are no running instances of IDL that can access it.
# Altering this file outside of IDL's control while an
# IDL session is running can cause your changes to be ignored
# or lost.
